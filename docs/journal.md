### 2025-09-01

* **Problems Solved:** Two Sum
* **Spring Progress:** None yet.
* **Key Learnings:**

  * Indices donâ€™t need to be neighbors in Two Sum.
  * HashMap single-pass solution beats brute force.
  * Writing explanations out loud helps retention.
* **Questions:**

  1. How to avoid pairing the same element with itself?
* **Next Steps:** Continue with Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock.

### 2025-09-02

* **Problems Solved:** Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock, Valid Anagram (initial).
* **Spring Progress:** None yet.
* **Key Learnings:**

  * O(n) vs O(n log n): constants matter in real life.
  * Valid Anagram can be solved by sorting or counting.
* **Questions:**

  1. Why does LeetCode runtime vary between 1ms and 2ms?
* **Next Steps:** Finish Valid Anagram optimized solution.

### 2025-09-03

* **Problems Solved:** Valid Anagram (all variations), Median of Two Sorted Arrays (in progress).
* **Spring Progress:** None.
* **Key Learnings:**

  * Array counting trick is fastest for anagrams.
  * Median of two sorted arrays brute force works but isnâ€™t efficient.
* **Questions:**

  1. How to implement binary search partition for median problem?
* **Next Steps:** Continue median + study CPU cache.

### 2025-09-04

* **Problems Solved:** Continued Median of Two Sorted Arrays.
* **Spring Progress:** None.
* **Key Learnings:**

  * Binary search can reduce median problem to O(log(min(n,m))).
  * CPU cache effects mean O(n log n) can sometimes beat O(n).
* **Questions:**

  1. How to visualize cache locality in Java arrays?
* **Next Steps:** Start Radio Activity Peaks problem.

### 2025-09-05

* **Problems Solved:** Radio Activity Peaks, Group Anagrams (in progress).
* **Spring Progress:** None.
* **Key Learnings:**

  * Canonical key (sorted string or counts) makes Group Anagrams scalable.
  * Nested anagram checks cause TLE.
* **Questions:**

  1. Should I prefer sorted-string key or counts key for large inputs?
* **Next Steps:** Finish Group Anagrams and move to Top K Frequent Elements.
