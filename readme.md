# interviews-prep

This repository tracks a **4-week preparation plan** for Senior Java Backend interviews.  
It combines **algorithm problem-solving** and a **Spring Boot fraud detection project**.

## ðŸ“… Calendar (Week by Week)

The full day-by-day calendar with topics, tasks, and status is documented in  
[`docs/prep-calendar.md`](./docs/prep-calendar.md). Update the **Status** column daily.

## ðŸ§± Structure

- **[`problems-solving`](problems-solving/readme.md)/** â†’ algorithms in Java, following LeetCode problem order numbers.  
- **[`fraud-detection-lite`](fraud-detection-lite/readme.md)/** â†’ backend project with modules: `fraud-ingestor`, `risk-service`, later `alerts-service`.  
- **docs/** â†’ calendar, daily journal (reflections, notes).

## âœ… Daily Flow

1. **Morning (AM)** â†’ Solve 1â€“2 LeetCode problems (brute force â†’ optimized â†’ tests â†’ commit).  
2. **Afternoon (PM)** â†’ Build 1 small vertical slice in Spring Boot fraud detection project.  
3. **Evening** â†’ Reflect in [`docs/journal.md`](./docs/journal.md).

## Goals

- Demonstrate **pattern mastery** in algorithms.  
- Show **production-level engineering** with Spring Boot, Kafka, Drools, Docker.  
- Build a strong GitHub footprint.
