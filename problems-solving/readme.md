# Problems Solving

This folder contains **LeetCode problems**, solved in Java 17, following the official problem numbering.  
Each problem lives in its own package, with `Solution.java` + `SolutionTest.java` and a short README.

---

## ðŸ“– Approach

For each problem:
1. **Start with brute force.**
2. **Optimize to best known solution.**
3. **Write JUnit tests.**
4. **Add a short README** (pattern, complexity, pitfalls).
5. **Commit cleanly**.

## ðŸ§± Structure
- **p[leetcode order number]_problemTitle/** â†’ folder where the problem's solution is implemented.

---

## ðŸ§© Notes
- Use **Java 17**, clean OOP, avoid over-streaming.
- Timebox: 25m solve, 10m refactor, 10m tests, 5m notes.
- Always explain complexity & edge cases in the problemâ€™s README.
